Hello little girl

Hello little girl

Hello little girl



When I see you everyday

I say, &quot;Mm mm hello little girl&quot;

When you're passing on your way

I say, &quot;Mm mm hello little girl&quot;

When I see you passing by

I cry, &quot;Mm mm hello little girl&quot;

When I try to catch your eye

I cry, &quot;Mm mm hello little girl&quot;



I send you flowers but you don't care

You never seem to see me standing there

I often wonder what you're thinking of

I hope it's me and love love love



So I hope there'll come a day

When you'll say, &quot;Mm you're my little girl&quot;



It's not the first time that it's happened to me,

It's been a long lonely time

And it's funny funny to see that I'm about to lose my mind mind mind



So I hope there'll come a day

When you say, &quot;Mm mm

You're my little girl, mm mm mm

You're my little girl, mm mm mm&quot;

You're my little girl, oh yeah

You're my little girl



Do do do do do
