[Rodney Burke:] I've got one card here and it's on the same subject, eh, but this one says, &quot;We think the show is great and we dig the Beatles the most, but we still haven't heard a word from Ringo yet.&quot;

[Ringo:] Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!

[Rodney:] &quot;And how about him singing?&quot; Well, what will you sing for us, Ringo? Will you say a few words?

[Ringo:] Hello, there, kiddies. I'd like to sing a song for you today called &quot;Matchbox.&quot; There you go.

[Rodney:] Set fire to that lot. Okay, Ringo, thanks very much.

[Ringo:] Don't you et smart with me, you know.

[Rodney:] Do you mind? Get over to your microphone, &quot;Matchbox.&quot;
