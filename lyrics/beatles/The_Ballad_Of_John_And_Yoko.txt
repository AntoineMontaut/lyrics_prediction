Standing in the dock at Southampton

Trying to get to Holland or France

The man in the mac said, &quot;You've got to go back&quot;

You know they didn't even give us a chance



Christ you know it ain't easy

You know how hard it can be

The way things are going

They're going to crucify me



Finally made the plane into Paris

Honeymooning down by the Seine

Peter Brown called to say

&quot;You can make it OK

You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain&quot;



Christ you know it ain't easy

You know how hard it can be

The way things are going

They're going to crucify me



Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton

Talking in our beds for a week

The newspapers said, &quot;Say what you doing in bed?&quot;

I said, &quot;We're only trying to get us some peace&quot;



Christ you know it ain't easy

You know how hard it can be

The way things are going

They're going to crucify me



Saving up your money for a rainy day

Giving all your clothes to charity

Last night the wife said

&quot;Oh boy, when you're dead

You don't take nothing with you

But your soul, think!&quot;



Made a lightning trip to Vienna

Eating chocolate cake in a bag

The newspapers said, &quot;She's gone to his head

They look just like two gurus in drag&quot;



Christ you know it ain't easy

You know how hard it can be

The way things are going

They're going to crucify me



Caught an early plane back to London

Fifty acorns tied in a sack

The men from the press said, &quot;We wish you success

It's good to have the both of you back&quot;



Christ you know it ain't easy

You know how hard it can be

The way things are going

They're going to crucify me

The way things are going

They're going to crucify me
