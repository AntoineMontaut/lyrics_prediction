Like a rolling stone

Like a rolling stone

Ah like a rolling stone

Like the FBI and the CIA

And the BBC, BB King

And Doris Day

Matt Busby

Dig it, dig it, dig it

Dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it



[That was &quot;Can You Dig It&quot; by Georgie Wood. And now we'd like to do &quot;Hark The Angels Come&quot;.]
