[Brian Matthew:] But despite the fact that the next request comes from Anton, 32

Perry Road, Sherwood, in Nottingham, it's headed &quot;Up the Pool&quot; and starts,

&quot;Dear Wack!&quot; So, John, you take it from there.

[John:] &quot;Dear Wack! Please, ask thos gorgeous lads,&quot; ha, ha,&quot; called the Beatles

to sing 'You Really Got a Hold on Me' for Di, Gus, Wizz, and me, also for the

Beatles, themselves, especially Paul,&quot; ha, &quot;and everybody that was in the Roy

Orbison Tour. I'm a regular listener of 'Pop Go the Beatles,'&quot; good lad, &quot;and,

please, tell the boys that all the girls in our office think it is a fab show.

Thank you.&quot;

[Brian:] All right, stop the band. Oh, that's splendid and now, what are you

gonna sing for us?

[John:] &quot;You Really Got a Hold on Me...Mother.&quot;
