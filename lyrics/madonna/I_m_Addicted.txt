When did your name change from a word to a charm?

No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm

All of the letters push to the front of my mouth

And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout

And I canât get it out



When did your name change from language to magic?

Iâd write it again on the back of my hand,

And I know it sounds tragic



Feels like a drug

And I canât get enough

And it fits like a glove

Iâm addicted to your love

Iâm addicted to your love

Iâm addicted to your love



Iâm addicted, Iâm addicted, Iâm addicted to your...

Iâm addicted, Iâm addicted, Iâm addicted to your love



Now that your name

Pumps like the blood in my veins

Pulse through my body, igniting my mind

Itâs like MDMA and thatâs OK



Your name's like a drug

And I canât get enough

And it fits like a glove

Iâm addicted to your love



Iâm addicted, Iâm addicted, Iâm addicted to your...

Iâm addicted, Iâm addicted, Iâm addicted to your love



I need this exchange

I donât care if you think that Iâm strange

Something happens to me when I hear your voice

Something happens to me and I have no choice



I need to hear your name

Everything feels so strange

Iâm ready to take this chance

I need to dance



Feels like a drug

And I canât get enough

And it fits like a glove

Iâm addicted to your love



Iâm addicted, Iâm addicted, Iâm addicted to your...

Iâm addicted, Iâm addicted, Iâm addicted to your love



MDMA, MDMA, MDMA, MDMA (Iâm addicted)

MDMA, MDMA, MDMA, MDMA (Iâm addicted)
