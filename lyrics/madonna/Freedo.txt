&quot;No&quot; is just a word

That people say when they're afraid

And if you say &quot;no&quot; to me

Then I will fight you till I'm free



Say freedom, brotherhood

Justice, just say &quot;yes&quot;

Say freedom, brotherhood

Justice, just say &quot;yes&quot;



'Cause &quot;no&quot; is just a word

That people say when they can't cope

And if you say &quot;no&quot; to me

Then I will fight you till I'm free



Freedom, brotherhood

Justice, just say &quot;yes&quot;

Freedom, brotherhood

Justice, just say &quot;yes&quot;



'Cause &quot;no&quot; is just a word

That people say when they are lost

And if you say &quot;no&quot; to me

Then I will fight you till I'm free



Say freedom, brotherhood

Justice, just say &quot;yes&quot;

Freedom, brotherhood

Justice, just say &quot;yes&quot;



Say freedom, brotherhood

Justice, just say &quot;yes&quot; to me
