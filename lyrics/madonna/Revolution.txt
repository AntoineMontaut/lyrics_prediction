Iâm a poet, youâre a thief

Welcome to my side of the street

Drank my wine, freed the beast

Weâre all fighters in the revolution

 

Itâs calling out our names

Itâs a constitution

And our struggles are all the same

Who can you blame

The revolution

 

Itâs our job, we have no choice

Change the system, use your voice

Donât look back, no regrets

Strap your boots on, itâs a revolution

 

And itâs calling out your names

It's the constitution

Our struggles are all the same

Who can you blame

The revolution

 

Ainât no stopping us today

Better watch out, youâre in the way

Weâre the children of the future

Havenât you heard about the revolution

 

And itâs calling out your names

In the constitution

And our struggles are all the same

Who can you blame

The revolution

 

Ainât no stopping us today

Better watch out, youâre in the way

Weâre the children of the future

Havenât you heard about the revolution
