When the world starts to get you down

And nothing seems to go your way

And the noise of the maddening crowd

Makes you feel like youâre going to go insane



Thereâs a glow of a distant light

Calling you to come outside

To feel the wind on your face and your skin

And itâs here I begin my story



Turn up the radio

Turn up the radio

Donât ask me where I wanna go

We gotta turn up the radio



It was time that I opened my eyes

Iâm leaving the past behind

Nothingâs ever what it seems

Including this time and these crazy dreams



Iâm stuck like a moth to a flame

Iâm so tired of playing this game

I donât know how I got to this state

Let me out of my cage cause Iâm dying



Turn up the radio

Turn up the radio

Donât ask me where I wanna go

We gotta turn up the radio



Turn up the radio

Turn up the radio

Donât ask me where I wanna go

We gotta turn up the radio



I just wanna get in my car

I wanna go fast and I gotta go far

Donât ask me to explain how I feel

âCause I donât want to say where Iâm going



Turn down the noise and turn up the volume

Donât have a choice cause the temperatures pounding

Leaving this place is the last thing I do

That I want to escape with a person just like you



Iâm stuck like a moth to a flame

Iâm so sick and tired of playing this game

We gotta have fun it itâs all that we do

Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules

Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow



Turn up the radio

Turn up the radio

Donât ask me where I wanna go

We gotta turn up the radio



Turn up the radio

Turn up the radio

Thereâs somethings you donât need to know

Just let me turn up the radio



Turn up the radio

Just let me turn up the radio

Just let me turn up the radio
