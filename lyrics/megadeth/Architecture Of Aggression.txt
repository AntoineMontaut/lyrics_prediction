[Mustaine-Ellefson:]
Born from the dark
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy
Hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost
The spoils of wars are yours to keep

Great nations, built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw, blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your Architecture of Aggression

[Solo - Friedman:]
Ensuing power vacuum
A toppled leader dies
His body fuels the power fire
And the flames rise to the sky
One side of his face, a kiss
The other genocide
Time to pay with your ass
A worldwide suicide

&quot;Fight for America&quot;

&quot;Everybody knew that the 15th
Of January was the deadline date
By kicking the war off, once the war was over
People would be able to go home&quot;

&quot;They looked like big long snakes
Coming up in the air&quot;
&quot;Medium sized triple a, um, just, ah tracer bullets&quot;
