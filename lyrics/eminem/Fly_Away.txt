[Just Blaze - Chorus:]

Some people ask me, where Iâve been lately

They thought I fell off, nobody could save me

I play in the background, I donât back down

So donât get it twisted, tryna play me

First I come out, they underate me

Then I come back, still try to fade me

They say Iâm nasty, say Iâm crazy

Ask what I think, I say maybe

I fly away

It ainât nothinâ in my way so I may aswell fly away

It ainât nothinâ else to say so I may aswell fly away

I know you wanna see me down but we aint gon die today

Cos Iâve been to the top and thereâs nowhere else to go

The only way to see me is if you lookinâ up from down below

And thereâs nothinâ else to say so I may aswell fly away

And thereâs nothinâ in my way so I may aswell fly away

Iâm on top of this thing so i may aswell fly away



[Eminem - Verse 1:]

Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up

Iâma step up on the stage now, Iâm gonna strut

And walk around with my pants hanging over my butt

And you aint gotta tell me notinâ boy, get off of my nuts

It goes one for the money, two for the show

My shit donât stink, I dont think so

Wipe my ass with a tissue and roll it back up in a roll

Are you ready now, here we go

The bald eagle has landed

Iâm back in ya hair, sorry for leavinâ you stranded

Im twice as dread and evil and rancid

They cant sit, I donât think anybody understands it

Especially when the Worlds silly putty in ya hands, its playdough

I aint got to play though, they say I died in a fatal

Car crash, shows what they know

Shit if I did, itâd be a trailer not a car

The white trash star

I fuckin RV up like Brett Favre

Homie you got it backwards, your dippin your soup inside ya crackers

I can carry rap til my back hurts

Set it down go right back to the Chiropractors

Get my back right

Now Iâm right back on you bastards

I was chasinâ the dragon, I dont know what happened

It was like the feelinâ I had when I first started rappinâ

I just couldânt seem to get back and recapture that magic

So I went back to the lab, thats where Iâve been at when...

[Eminem - Verse 2:]

I took a hiatus haters now Iâm back to cause trouble

Got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles

Im the *bang* you aint fuckin sick

The hospital wonât even give you cough drops for course cocksucker

You think your hot, you aint even luke warm

My pubes hotter than you

Your soft I use fire to cool me off

I told em Iâll grow up one day and show âem Iâd be able to choke clouds

Pick up lighteninâ bolts and throw âem

Take the world by storm with these words I form

Georgie porgie kissed the girls, make the girls cry for em

Make âem swarm, make âem fight over the shirts Iâve worn

Sworn over my sweat towels, its mind blowin

Yes Im livinâ the dream homie, cant nothinâ compare

Iâm so up, Iâm stuck in mid air Iâm lovinâ it yeah

Its like these people are steps now, all they do is stare

These haters is so pussy theyâre afraid to be scared

This is pay back, like I owe âem back pay

They spat in my face, now Iâm back to do them the same exact way

And leave this rap game with a bad taste,

And slap it back out, before I step back out of this crap thanks

Slap me now Iâm slapping âem back hey! fuck it weâll slap back

But yeh okay now weâll talk cause Iâm smack ay

And I aint looking back infact they can stare at my ass crack

Howâs that for hindsight, what the track say?
