Yeah, yeah, I get it

I run this rap shit, now guess whoâs back

You thought I left you, now why would I do that? (1, 2, 3)



They keep on sayinâ the same rappers are the best

Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe theyâre just tryna distract it

From the fact that Iâm cominâ back

Or maybe itâs cause I ainât black, maybe itâs because of that

Maybe itâs because Iâm the highest sellinâ artist in rap

While Iâm sittinâ back in my office jackinâ off to my plaques

Iâm still sick, how can I be sick this long

And Iâm still alive, Magic Johnson arise

I thrive on makinâ my opponents think that Iâve died

Thatâs when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there

Damn I forgot how much money he got

On the beach of Saint-Tropez, but your man donât lay

In the sun cause I donât tan, I burn, blood clot

When you gonna learn how much money weâve earned

How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25

And coulda retired at 29 in my 20â²s still

And Fifâ here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit

And he ainât even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick

No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score

To go from sellinâ bags to bottles right out the store

And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us

My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers

So stay the fuck off us, we make pay

Iâm just a super easy modest MC, okay?

Til I hear the word has been, thatâs when I start spazzinâ

Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then

Iâm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards

Iâm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanyeâs glasses!
