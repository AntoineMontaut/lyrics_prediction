[Spoken]

Yo, it's time to get rid of this coward once and for all.

I'm sick of the motherfucker! Check this shit out!

[Rap]

I'll spit a racial slur, honky, sue me!

This shit is a horror flick,

But the black guy doesn't die in this movie!

Fuckin' wit Lotto, dawg, you gotta be kidding!

That makes me believe you really don't have a interest in living!

You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say?

I got a better chance joining the KKK.

Or some real shit, though, I like you

That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to

Fuck 'Lotto,' call me your leader

I feel bad I gotta murder that dude from &quot;Leave It To Beaver&quot;

I used to like that show, now you got me to &quot;fight back&quot; mode

But oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go!

I hate to do this, I would love for this shit to last

So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass

And all's well that ends OK.

So I'll end this shit wit a &quot;Fuck you, but have a nice day!&quot;

Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver

So was Eddie Haskal, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver

This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid!

Quick, someone get his ass another steroid!

&quot;Blahbity bloo blah blah blahbity bloo blah!&quot;

I ain't hear a word you said, &quot;hipidy hooblah!&quot;

Is that a tank top, or a new bra?

Look, Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boob job!

Didn't you listen to the last round, meat head?

Pay attention, you're sayin' the same shit that he said!

Matter fact, dog, here's a pencil

Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful,

And don't come back until something dope hits you

Fuck it! You can take the mic home with you!

Lookin' like a cyclone hit you,

Tank top screamin', &quot;Lotto, I don't fit you!&quot;

You see how far those white jokes get you

Boy's like &quot;How Vanilla Ice gonna diss you?&quot;

My motto: Fuck Lotto!

I get the 7 digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow!
