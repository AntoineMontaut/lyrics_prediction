Morning, Marshall.&quot; &quot;Morning, doc.&quot;  &quot;So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?&quot; &quot;Anxious.&quot;  &quot;Anxiety?&quot;  &quot;Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous.&quot;  &quot;Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. You found a sponsor yet?&quot;

&quot;Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back&quot;  &quot;Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't.&quot;  &quot;Well, yeah, I mean I godda start going to meetings first and... Wait, what?&quot;  &quot;Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your schedule, we know you're a busy person.&quot;

&quot;But I thought sobriety was the most important thing?&quot;

&quot;So what else are you thinking?&quot;

&quot;Um, well, I know I godda start practising the steps, and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them.&quot;  &quot;Steps?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, steps.&quot;  &quot;There's a lot of them, aren't there?  &quot;Well, twelve.&quot;

&quot;Christ, I don't even know them all.&quot;  &quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Anything else?&quot;  &quot;Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, what do I do if I find myself in a situation where maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?&quot;

&quot;Take a drink.&quot;  &quot;What?&quot;  &quot;Take a drink and you know, take the edge off.&quot;

&quot;Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to.&quot;  &quot;What, you mean these?&quot; [shakes pills]

&quot;Man, what the fuck! ?&quot; &quot;Marshall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts already? Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall... ? Marshall! ?  &quot;No, no, no, no, NO!&quot;
